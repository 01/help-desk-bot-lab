# Creating your first bot

The goal of the first exercise is to create your first bot using [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com).

## Exercise goals

To successfully complete this exercise, you must complete the following tasks:

- Configure your development environment
- Create a bot that accepts input from a user, "echoes" or sends the same text back to the user

### Development environment prerequisites

The configuration that is required for building bots will vary depending on the language you choose to use for development.

If you are using C#, all you need is an IDE, such as [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/).

If you are using Node.js, you will need both a code editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), installed, and the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime.

### Creating the bot in C#

In order to create C# bots, you first need to install the Microsoft.Bot.Builder NuGet package. Installing this package adds the project templates for building bots.

### Creating the bot in Node.js

Like most Node.js development packages, installation of `botbuilder` is managed via NPM. While you can install this globally, generally speaking the best practice is to install the package as a dependency in your `package.json` file.

You may find helpful resources in the [Bot Framework documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/).
