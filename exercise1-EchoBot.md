# Exercise 1: Creating Your First "Echo" Bot with the Bot Builder SDK

The goal of the first exercise is to create your first bot using the SDKs of the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com).

## Goals

To successfully complete this exercise, you must complete the following tasks:

* Configure your development environment
* Create a bot that accepts input from a user, "echoes" or sends the same text back to the user

## Prerequisites

The configuration that is required for building bots will vary depending on the language you choose to use for development.

If you are using C#, all you need is an IDE, such as [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/) or higher.

If you are using Node.js, you will need both a code editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), installed, and the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime.

## Creating the Bot in C#

In order to create C# bots, you first need to install the Microsoft.Bot.Builder NuGet package. Installing this package adds the project templates for building bots.

## Creating the Bot in Node.js

Like most Node.js development packages, installation of `botbuilder` is managed via NPM. While you can install this globally, generally speaking the best practice is to install the package as a dependency in your `package.json` file.

You may find helpful resources in the [Bot Framework documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/).
